    message: `The experience was excellent, it was my first impression of the E-cell and it was as good as it can be. I could also see the positive changes between the presentations/case studies I made before the startup weekend and the ones I worked on after the GSW.`

    message: `GSW was my first time pitching anything in college - and we went in with “What The Finance,” an AI chatbot that aimed to be a one-stop personal finance guide. Honestly, the pitch was half-cooked, and it definitely wasn’t easy. But I think one of the most valuable things I learned was how to keep people from leaving the team - just talking, listening, and convincing. That’s something I’d never done before. I also got my first real taste of team management; from trying to get people to show up on time, to encouraging everyone to actually speak up and share their thoughts, even if they were unsure. It was chaotic, but it was fun.…We didn’t end up on the podium, but “What The Finance” and GSW gave me one of my best memories from first year.`

    message: `Being part of Google Startup Weekend was a really great experience. Our team worked on an idea to put digital screens on taxis, making advertising easier and more effective. In just a short time, we managed to plan, build a basic version (MVP), and present it to the judges. We also met many mentors and experts who shared valuable advice about how to improve our idea and how to take a startup forward. The whole event taught us how to work under tight deadlines, make quick decisions, stay organized as a team, and be confident while pitching our idea to others.`

    message: `Participating in Google Startup Weekend was one of the most transformative experiences of my first year. Despite having no technical skills or startup idea, I joined the hackathon with a strong desire to learn. I became part of a team working on women’s safety wearables, and through intense mentorship and brainstorming, we completely reshaped our idea and approach. The event exposed me to powerful, solution driven thinking and the energy of like minded individuals. I gained hands-on experience in team coordination, pitching, problem-solving, adaptability, and critical thinking. Most importantly, I formed meaningful connections within the startup ecosystem.`

    message: `We pitched an idea around panic attacks and wanted to differentiate them from heart attacks since their physical symptoms are very similar. Initially, it seemed impractical as it was an A-grade prototype, but after going near hospitals and asking around, we found it’s actually a major issue. Mentors then suggested turning it into a physical product with better accuracy. My biggest takeaway was to be realistic while prototyping. I learnt how to explore the market, take actions quickly after getting advice, how to work with a team, and how to use canvas to make a solid presentation to enlighten your idea in a better manner.`

    message: `My GSW journey began with a voice-change startup idea. I pitched it, found like-minded teammates, and we wrapped up most tasks by Friday. On the final day, we reached E-Hall early and started discussing our MVP. That’s when our senior, and after hearing his pitch, we pivoted in a new direction. I learnt that while it's important to believe in your idea, being open to change is just as crucial. A startup isn’t just about coding, it’s about real-world validation. I also picked up how to handle team debates, understand startup fundamentals, create and present an MVP, and even grasp some key FinTech concepts. My advice: present your idea to the right audience, make a practical pitch, and stick to your schedule.`
